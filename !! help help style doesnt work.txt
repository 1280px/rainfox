=== [0] if you just copied the files to the chrome folder and nothing happened, 
you probably forgot to restart Firefox. 

Just quit Firefox and open it again after some time.

Also check if you installed in the correct folder (check tutorial for details)

https://github.com/1280px/rainfox/blob/master/README.md



=== [1] are you sure you configured your Firefox right?

open about:config and make sure these settings set to TRUE:

toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
	(enables userChrome CSS)

svg.context-properties.content.enabled
	(allows custom SVGs use colors)

	also you can change this option to FALSE, but this is optional:
security.secure_connection_icon_color_gray
	(it'll make HTTPS connection icon uses green color instead of gray)

	...and restart your Firefox!



=== [2] make sure you're using AT LEAST Firefox 90.0!

Firefox 88 and earlier is NOT supported at all;

Firefox 89 is partially supported (no bugfixes for it though)



=== [3] go to
https://github.com/1280px/rainfox/blob/master/userChrome.css

	and copy everything from the big text field to the 'userChrome.css'
	...and restart your Firefox!

It may help if you corrupted 'userChrome.css' by accident



=== [4] well, it seems your copy of this style is really screwed up.

Try to redownload it completely from 
https://github.com/1280px/rainfox/blob/master/

Replace all the files in the 'chrome' folder
	...and restart your Firefox!



=== [5] if it doesn't help, we only have radical steps left. 

	Don't forget to back up your Firefox data before doing it!

Clean Firefox (check tutorial in the Internet)

	and if it doesn't help:

Reinstall Firefox completely (also check tutorial in the Internet)



=== that's it! In 99.99% of cases your style should work.

if it doesn't... well, I don't know. 

try to content Mozilla support or ask on https://reddit.com/r/firefox/



	hope this note was helpful to you ~uwu~
