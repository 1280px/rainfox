# / 　/ //　/　/　　RainFox v0.3a　//　/ /　　//
Started as remix of MaterialFox and QuietFox, the main task of this userChrome.css style<br>
is to make Firefox more theme-adaptive, smooth and homogeneous. 
After Proton UI concepts came it, this style also tend to be some kind of "Photon-theme-Restorer"
but with some improvements of the previous design.

<br><i>This style is not finished! Some features are still WIP</i>

<b>RainFox has these nice features:</b>
- Animated auto-hide bookmark panel
- Lots of elements are now has nice small (0.2s) animations!
- Theme-adaptive context menus
- Renewed 'Customize...' page (also theme-adaptive)
- Small rounded tabs without stupid line at top
- Small URLbar changes
- Hourglass tab loading animation
<br><i>　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　..and more!<i>
  You can also configure what features should be included in <code>userChrome.css</code>,<br> 
  or change some values (such as UI roundness, animation speed etc.)

<b>Style was tested on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. 
  I'll also appreciate your feedback on MacOS and Linux!</b>
