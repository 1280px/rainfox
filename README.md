# / 　/ //　/　/　　RainFox v0.2a　//　/ /　　//
Started as remix of MaterialFox and QuietFox, the main task of this userChrome.css style<br>
is to make Firefox more theme-adaptive, smooth and homogeneous. 
<i>Currently this style is about 50% done but even now it makes 
Firefox usage experience so much better!</i>

<b>RainFox has these cool features:</b>
- [optional] Animated auto-hide bookmark panel*
- Theme-adaptive context menus and [WIP]pop-ups
- [coming soon] Theme-adaptive pages
- Renewed 'Customize...' page (also theme-adaptive)
- Small rounded tabs without Win10-like line at top
- 1px URLbar borders changed to shadows
- Customizable tabs & buttons rounding and animation speed
- [optional] Hourglass loading tab animation*<br><i>　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　..and more!<i><br>*currently impossible to turn OFF; change values in userChrome.css to customize

<b>Style tested on Windows 7 64bit, Windows 8.1 64bit and Windows 10 64bit</b>
